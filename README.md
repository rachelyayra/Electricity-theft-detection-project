# Electricity Theft Detection using SMOTE with Tomek Links and XGBOOST


## Overview

This project, developed as a final year project, focuses on the detection of electricity theft using advanced machine learning techniques. The primary approach employed here is the combination of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) with Tomek Links to address the issue of data imbalance. Additionally, various features, including the coefficient of variation, peak and minimum consumption months, and shape of each data point, are extracted and used to train an XGBoost classifier. This readme provides an overview of the project, its implementation details, and performance metrics in comparison to benchmark models.


## Data
- The data used is confidential and is from the Electricity Company of Ghana.
- It is aggregated monthly

- Data imbalance addressed using SMOTE with Tomek Links.
- Key features extracted:
  - Coefficient of variation in each data point.
  - Peak and minimum consumption months.
  - Shape of each data point.
- Utilized XGBoost classifier for detection.
