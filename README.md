# Electricity-theft-detection-project
This technique of electricity theft detection was developed as my final year project.
In this project, SMOTE with Tomek Links was used to combat data imbalance.
The coefficient of variation in each data point as well as the peak and minimum consumption month
were extracted as features. The shape of each datapoint was also considered as a feature.
These features were then used to train an XGBoost classifier. The code details the performance of 
this technique as well as other models used as a benchmark
